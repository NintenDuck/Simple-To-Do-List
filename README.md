# Simple-To-Do-List
## What is it?
**My god**, just a simple **ToDo Checklist**
***

## Why?
I have encountered (and used) a lot of ToDo applications in my file, all of them are honestly amazing.

However...

A lot of those applications have features like groups, sections, menus, accounts and other extra stuff that honestly just cloud actual productivity (in my opinion of course).

This application is made for **Those people** that just want to **write chores down and get stuff done**.

## Features

- Add Tasks
- Delete Tasks
- Yeah, that's it honestly

## Install Instructions
No release yet, so, no instructions (sadly).
